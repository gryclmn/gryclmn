## Hi, I'm Gary Coleman

**Senior Software Engineer** — Android/Kotlin, Unity/C#, cross-platform work

I'm looking for my next role after 6+ years at Ergatta building fitness gaming apps. Most of my experience is Android (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM), but I've also spent the last 3 years working in Unity/C# and bridging data between the two platforms.

I'm open to Android, Unity, or honestly any language — I enjoy learning new things.
